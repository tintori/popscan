Description: This package analyses a directory of raw scanner images and a metadata table. It uses ImageJ to crop images and convert them into pixel intesity histograms, then uses the standard deviation of those histograms to track population growth, and report data and plots about the amount of time each sample took to consume all the food on the petri dish.
